                <b> Abstract. </b> A Blockchain system such as Ethereum is a peer to peer network
                      where each node works in three phases: creation, mining, and vali-
                      dation phases. In the creation phase, it executes a subset of locally
                      cached transactions to form a new block. In the mining phase, the
                      node solves a cryptographic puzzle (Proof of Work - PoW) on the
                      block it forms. On receiving a block from another peer, it starts the
                      validation phase, where it executes the transactions in the received
                      block in order to ensure all transactions are valid. This execution
                      also updates the blockchain state, which must be completed before
                      creating the next block. A long block validation time lowers the
                      system’s overall throughput and brings the well known Verifier’s
                      dilemma into play. Additionally, this leads to wasted mining power
                      utilization (MPU).<br>
                      &nbsp &nbsp Through extensive measurement of 2000 nodes from the produc-
                      tion Ethereum network we find that during block validation, nodes
                      redundantly execute more than 80% of the transactions in greater
                      than 75% of the blocks they receive - this points to significant
                      potential to save time and computation during block validation.<br>
                      &nbsp &nbsp Motivated by this, we present Renoir, a novel mechanism that
                      caches state from transaction execution during the block creation
                      phase and reuses it to enable nodes to skip (re)executing these trans-
                      actions during block validation. Our detailed evaluation of Renoir
                      on a 50 node testbed mimicking the top 50 Ethereum miners illus-
                      trates that when gas limit is increased to 20 times the default value,
                      to accommodate computationally intensive transactions, Renoir
                      reduces validation time by 90% compared to Ethereum. In addi-
                      tion, throughput of Ethereum reduces from 35326 tx/hour to 24716
                      tx/hour and MPU from 96% to 67% but these barely change for
                      Renoir. Furthermore, we deploy a node running Renoir on the
                      production Ethereum network. Our measurement illustrates that
                      Renoir reduces the block validation time by as much as 50%<br><br>

                <b> Abstract. </b> Cryptocurrency networks are a promising infrastructure
                              for pseudonymous online payments. However, low
                              throughput has prevented their widespread acceptance. A
                              promising solution to scale throughput is the Payment channel
                              network (PCN), exemplified by the Lightning Network (LN),
                              that uses a network of off-chain bidirectional payment channels
                              between parties that wish to transact often. Since payments use
                              the shortest paths with sufficient funds over this network, channel
                              balances get exhausted in the direction transactions flow and
                              eventually become unidirectional. This results in transactions
                              failing and consequently a lower transaction success ratio. Our
                              observations on the production LN show that over 63% of the
                              channels lose over 80% of the channel balance in one direction
                              over time, which makes the success ratio of a real-world workload
                              drop from 71% to 29%. A unidirectional channel along a path
                              results in a failure message back to the source that recomputes the
                              path, excluding the failed channel and reattempts the transaction,
                              thus adding to the completion latency even for those transactions
                              that do complete.<br>
                              &nbsp &nbsp We propose REBAL, a distributed re-balancing mechanism,
                              and a new routing scheme to address the above issues. REBAL
                              maximizes the extent to which channels can be re-balanced across
                              the entire network. REBAL addresses the completion latency
                              issue by re-routing transactions from intermediate nodes around
                              a unidirectional channel rather than propagating the failure back
                              to the source.<br>
                              &nbsp &nbsp Our comprehensive evaluation of REBAL shows that the success
                              ratio improves from 30.18% to 79.54% and success volume
                              from 3.98% to 29.99% for a real-world workload derived from
                              the Ripple network, without adversely impacting the transaction
                              latency. Even at very high transaction rates, REBAL outperforms
                              Lightning Network Daemon (LND- a Golang implementation of
                              LN) (12%) with a success ratio of 43.76%.<br><br>

                    <b> Abstract. </b> Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum)
                    of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In
                    such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs
                    and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (𝜏) introduces the popularly known Verifier’s
                    Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large 𝜏 also reduces the tolerance
                    for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a.
                    off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve.<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale 𝜏/I ≈ 1 in PoW
                    blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC
                    mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to 𝜁 blocks,
                    where 𝜁 is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial
                    strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay Δ and demonstrate that Tuxedo
                    achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype
                    implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale 𝜏 without suffering the harmful
                    effects of naïve scaling up of 𝜏/I in existing blockchains. <br><br>

                <i> Abstract. </i> In the winter of 2016, Boston Public Schools (BPS) launched a crowdsourcing national competition to create a better way to construct bus routes to improve efficiency, deepen the ability to model policy changes, and realign school start times. The winning team came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They developed an algorithm to construct school bus routes, by assigning students to stops, combining stops into routes, and optimally assigning vehicles to routes. BPS has used this algorithm for two years running; in the summer of 2017, this led to a 7% reduction in the BPS bus fleet. Bus routing optimization also gives BPS the unprecedented ability to understand the financial impact of new policies that affect transportation. In particular, the MIT research team developed a new mathematical model to select start times for all schools in the district in a way that takes transportation into account. Using this methodology, BPS proposed a solution that would have saved an additional $12M annually, and shifted students to more developmentally appropriate school start times (by reducing the number of high school students starting before 8:00 a.m. from 74% to 6% and the average number of elementary school students dismissed after 4:00 pm from 33% to 15%). However, 85% of the schools’ start times would have been changed, with a median change of one hour. This magnitude of change was too dramatic for the district to absorb, as evidenced by strong vocal opposition from some of the school communities who were negatively affected, and the plan was not implemented.<br><br>

                <i> Summary. </i> Spreading start times allows school districts to reduce transportation costs by reusing buses between schools. However, assigning each school a time involves both estimating the impact on transportation costs and reconciling additional competing objectives. These challenges force many school districts to make myopic decisions, leading to an expensive and inequitable status quo. For instance, most American teenagers start school before 8:00 AM, despite evidence of significant associated health issues. We propose an algorithm to jointly solve the school bus routing and bell time selection problems. Our application in Boston led to $5 million in yearly savings (maintaining service quality despite a 50-bus fleet reduction) and to the unanimous approval of the first school start time reform in 30 years.<br><br>

                    <i> Summary. </i> Understanding complex city traffic patterns is a major priority for modern urban planners, leading to a sharp increase in the amount and the diversity of traffic data being collected. For instance, taxi companies in many major cities now record metadata for every individual car ride, such as its origin, destination, and travel time. In this paper, we show that we can leverage network optimization insights to extract accurate travel time estimations from such origin–destination data, using information from a large number of taxi trips to reconstruct the traffic patterns in an entire city. Using synthetic data, we establish the robustness of our algorithm to high variance data, and the interpretability of its results. We then use hundreds of thousands of taxi travel time observations in Manhattan to show that our algorithm can provide insights about urban traffic patterns on different scales and accurate travel time estimations throughout the network. <br><br>

                <i> Abstract. </i> When quantitative models are used to support decision-making on complex and important topics, understanding a model's "reasoning" can increase trust in its predictions, expose hidden biases, or reduce vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, the concept of interpretability remains loosely defined and application-specific. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework in which machine learning models are constructed in a sequence of interpretable steps. We show that for a variety of models, a natural choice of interpretable steps recovers standard interpretability proxies (e.g., sparsity in linear models). We then generalize these proxies to yield a parametrized family of consistent measures of model interpretability. This formal definition allows us to quantify the "price" of interpretability, i.e., the tradeoff with predictive accuracy. We demonstrate practical algorithms to apply our framework on real and synthetic datasets.<br><br>
